# FlashLoan Arbitrage Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a flash loan arbitrage strategy in the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract utilizes the capabilities of flash loans to borrow assets from a liquidity pool provider, performs a quick arbitrage transaction between assets with a price difference, and then returns the loan with a fee, all in a single transaction.

## Features

- **Flash Loan Arbitrage:** The contract executes a flash loan, capitalizing on price differences between assets to perform an arbitrage trade.

- **Hardhat:** The project is built using the Hardhat development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

- **NPM:** Node Package Manager is used for package management and script execution.

- **Solidity:** The smart contract is written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Usage

1. **Deploy Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

2. **Execute Flash Loan Arbitrage:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/arbitrage.js
   ```

## Configuration

- Customize the flash loan parameters, such as the pool provider address, arbitrage trading logic, and fee structure in the smart contract.

## Risks and Considerations

- Flash loan transactions involve high complexity and risk. Thoroughly test and understand the potential risks before deploying the smart contract in a live environment.
